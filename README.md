This website was created by Zubair Mallik. It is a clone of an iPhone website, built using the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Three.js
- GSAP

## Features

- Fully responsive design
- Interactive 3D elements
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Learning Experience

During the development of this project, I learned a lot, especially about Three.js. I gained a deeper understanding of:

- How Three.js works
- Setting up the Three.js environment
- Logic building for the video carousel

I also had a lot of fun integrating React with Three.js and GSAP. This is my first project that involves Three.js, and it was a great experience.

## Conclusion

This project has not only improved my skills in web development but also opened new avenues for creating interactive and dynamic web experiences using advanced technologies.
